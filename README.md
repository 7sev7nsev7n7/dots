# Dotfiles for Hyprland

simple dotfiles for hyprland setup. i refuse to make an installation script (for the time being)

just make sure to copy the files to their appropriate directories and you should be good to go. consider 'root' to be the root mountpoint

## NOTE

some configuration files (specifically `dunst` and `swaylock`) will only work after an initial loading of said configurations via `wal`

- waybar (top/status bar)
- asusctl (hardware-specific)
- backlight_control (self-explanatory)
- pipewire/pipewire-pulse + wireplumber

you can supply your own wallpapers if you desire
